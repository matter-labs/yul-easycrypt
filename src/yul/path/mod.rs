//!
//! Path from the root of YUL syntax tree to some location in it.
//!
//! In YUL code it is possible to have variables with the same name located in different lexical scopes, for example:
//! ```
//! function sample() {
//! let x
//! {
//!    let y := add(1, x)
//! }
//! {
//!    let y := add(1, x)
//! }
//! }
//! ```
//! In this example, `y` refers to different variables. If a code analysis
//! needs information about both of them, we can differentiate between them
//! based on their lexical scopes; each scope is then identified by a path from
//! the root of YUL syntax tree to its block.
//!
